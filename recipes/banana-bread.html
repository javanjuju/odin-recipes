        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Banana bread is a type of cake made from mashed bananas.It is often a moist 
            and sweet quick bread but some recipes are yeast raised.
        </p>
        <p>
            Banana bread recipes began to feature in well-known cookbooks across 
            North America as baking soda and baking powder were being mass produced 
            and becoming available in grocery stores in the 1930s. It appeared in 
            Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook,and later gained more 
            acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book 
            in 1950

        <p>
            This banana bread recipe should be perfectly baked after about an hour in 
            an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. You'll know it's done when a toothpick 
            inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Make sure you let the 
            bread sit in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out. Otherwise, 
            it might not stay in one piece.
