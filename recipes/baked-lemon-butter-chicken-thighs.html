        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>                   
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place 3 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in a microwave oven 
                until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Smash garlic cloves with the side of a chef's knife 
                and add garlic to the warm butter. Stir in lemon juice and onion powder; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle both sides of chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 
                tablespoon butter in a medium oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Brown 
                chicken, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and brush skin 
                with lemon-butter mixture. Pour remaining butter mixture into skillet and remove 
                from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the 
                juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the 
                bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Brush skin every 10 minutes with 
                pan juices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove skillet from the oven and place chicken on a serving platter. Drizzle chicken 
                with pan juices and garnish with parsley.
            </li>
